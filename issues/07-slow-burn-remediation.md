# Slow Burn Remediation Engine

## Overview

Implement a sophisticated threat remediation system that performs gradual, stealthy removal of APTs to prevent retaliation, self-deletion triggers, or alerting the threat actors. This component balances thorough threat elimination with operational security and system stability.

## Technical Requirements

### Gradual Removal Strategy
- **Phased Elimination**: Multi-stage removal process with configurable delays
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understand threat component dependencies before removal
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate removal impact and potential threat retaliation
- **Stealth Operations**: Perform removal actions that mimic normal system behavior
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to reverse removal actions if needed

### Staging and Timing Control
- **Configurable Delays**: User-definable delays between removal steps
- **Scheduled Removal**: Time-based scheduling for optimal removal windows
- **Condition-Based Triggers**: Removal based on system state or threat behavior
- **Priority Management**: Prioritize removal of high-risk components
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and report removal progress

### Kill-Switch Functionality
- **Emergency Quarantine**: Immediate threat isolation when activated
- **Rapid Containment**: Fast containment of all detected threats
- **System Preservation**: Maintain system functionality during emergency response
- **Recovery Mode**: Quick recovery from kill-switch activation
- **Override Controls**: Administrative override for kill-switch operations

### Component Isolation
- **Process Termination**: Gradual process termination to avoid detection
- **File Quarantine**: Move malicious files to secure quarantine area
- **Registry Cleanup**: Remove malicious registry entries (Windows)
- **Network Isolation**: Block network communications for specific threats
- **Service Disabling**: Disable malicious services and daemons

### Self-Deletion Prevention
- **Trigger Detection**: Identify potential self-deletion mechanisms
- **Watchdog Protection**: Monitor for threat component monitoring
- **Decoy Operations**: Perform decoy actions to mask real removal
