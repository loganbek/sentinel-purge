# Security Considerations

## Overview

Implement comprehensive security measures for the SentinelPurge framework to ensure the system remains trustworthy, tamper-resistant, and maintains operational security while hunting APTs. This includes establishing secure development practices, cryptographic implementations, and defense-in-depth strategies.

## Technical Requirements

### Open Source Security Model
- **Open Core Architecture**: Core detection engine and framework open source
- **Hardened Binaries**: Optional commercially-hardened and certified builds
- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic compilation for verification

### Cryptographic Requirements
- **Code Signing**: All binaries signed with hardware security modules (HSM)
- **Update Verification**: Cryptographic signature verification for all updates
- **Communication Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Data Protection**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- **Key Management**: Secure key derivation and rotation mechanisms

### Air-Gapped Operation
- **No Cloud Dependency**: Full functionality without internet connectivity
- **Local Threat Intelligence**: Embedded signature databases
- **Offline Updates**: Manual update packages with signature verification

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Security Practices
1. **Secure SDLC**: Security requirements integrated from design phase
2. **Code Review**: All security-critical code reviewed by security experts
3. **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessment of dependencies
5. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing by external teams

### Cryptographic Implementation
1. **Industry Standards**: Use well-established cryptographic libraries
2. **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral keys for all communications
3. **Quantum Resistance**: Plan for post-quantum cryptography migration
4. **Side-Channel Protection**: Protection against timing and cache attacks

### Operational Security
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Fail Secure**: System fails to secure state on errors
4. **Security Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting

### Privacy Protection
1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
2. **Anonymization**: Remove PII from logs and telemetry
3. **Local Processing**: Sensitive analysis performed locally
4. **User Consent**: Clear opt-in for data sharing features

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
