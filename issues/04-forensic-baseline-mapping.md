# Forensic Baseline Mapping

## Overview

Build a comprehensive system baseline mapping and comparison engine that establishes known-good system states and continuously monitors for deviations. This component is critical for detecting subtle APT modifications to system files, configurations, and runtime environments.

## Technical Requirements

### Baseline Collection
- **System Files**: Cryptographic hashes and metadata for all system binaries and libraries
- **Configuration Files**: Complete system configuration snapshot including registry (Windows), system configs (Linux/macOS)
- **Autorun Entries**: All automatic startup mechanisms across platforms
- **Network Configuration**: Network interfaces, routes, firewall rules, and DNS settings
- **User Accounts**: User and group configurations, permissions, and access rights
- **Services/Daemons**: All system services, their configurations, and dependencies

### File System Analysis
- **Hash-Based Verification**: SHA-256 hashes for integrity verification
- **Metadata Tracking**: File timestamps, permissions, ownership, and attributes
- **Digital Signatures**: Verify code signing on executable files
- **File Reputation**: Cross-reference with global reputation databases
- **Change Detection**: Identify unauthorized modifications to system files

### Registry Analysis (Windows)
- **Complete Registry Snapshot**: Full Windows registry baseline
- **Critical Key Monitoring**: Focus on security-critical registry locations
