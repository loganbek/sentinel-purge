# sentinel-purge

Here's a brainstorm for an advanced, cross-platform APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) Removal Tool, designed to be thorough, stealth-aware, and capable of deep remediation over days or weeks. Let's call it:

üõ°Ô∏è "SentinelPurge" ‚Äî APT Hunting & Eradication Framework
üîß Core Goals
Identify and remove APTs without compromising system functionality.

Work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Remain stealthy to avoid detection by the APT.

Time-flexible: Operate over long periods for deep scanning (days/weeks).

Minimal user input but with advanced controls for power users.

Can recover, restore, or rollback compromised systems.

üß† Key Features
1. Cross-Platform Agent (Rust + Golang Core)
Lightweight background agent with modular design.

Hooks into system-level APIs for detection.

Executes sandboxed modules to reduce infection risk.

2. Hybrid Scanning Engine
Combines signature-based, behavioral, heuristic, and ML-driven methods.

Pulls from open threat intel (MISP, VirusTotal, YARA rules, Sigma rules).

Conducts longitudinal scanning (e.g., compare process/network anomalies over time).

3. Forensic Baseline Mapping
Builds a known-good baseline of system files, autoruns, registry settings, daemons, etc.

Compares against a global reputation DB and anomaly patterns.

Supports timeline and graph-based forensic analysis.

4. Memory & Kernel Analysis
Live memory snapshotting and periodic diffing.

Detects rootkits, kernel-level hooks, injected code.

Leverages volatility framework (extended cross-platform).

5. Network Sinkhole Monitor
Detects and optionally reroutes traffic to suspected C2 servers to a local sinkhole for analysis.

DNS poisoning detection, DoH/TOR proxy detection.

Built-in firewall rules enforcement for containment.

6. Slow Burn Remediation Engine
Gradual, stealthy removal to prevent retaliation or self-deletion triggers.

Optional live kill-switch to quarantine everything instantly.

Support for staging removal steps (e.g., "delay registry removal by 2 days").

7. Isolation & Recovery
Can snapshot entire systems (VM-style) before starting removal.

Sandboxes suspicious processes in real time.

Integration with cloud backups (optional) to restore uninfected states.

8. Covert Mode
Appears as a generic background service/process.

Can rename its components and change hashes to avoid APT targeting.

Optional "sleep mode" to remain undetectable for hours/days.

üíª OS-Specific Adaptations
ü™ü Windows
Sysinternals integration, ETW telemetry, WMI analysis.

LSASS and SAM monitoring.

Automatic group policy reset.

üêß Linux
Analyzes systemd, crontabs, /etc/rc.local, and system binaries.

Looks for LD_PRELOAD and .so injection.

Checks init scripts, SSH authorized_keys, sudo abuse.

üçé macOS
Monitors LaunchAgents, LaunchDaemons, kernel extensions.

Detects TCC.db abuse, AppleScript backdoors, hidden apps.

üìä User Interface & Logging
CLI + GUI frontend.

Centralized dashboard (optional web interface or local-only).

Audit trail for every action (for forensics or compliance).

Log anonymization/sharing option for crowd-sourced detection.

üîí Security Considerations
Open Source Core with optional hardened binaries.

No cloud dependency by default (can run fully air-gapped).

Signed updates with reproducible builds.

üß∞ Optional Modules
Active Deception: Lure the APT into revealing itself (fake credentials, honeypots).

Auto Threat Reporting: Submits unknown indicators to hybrid analysis backends.

SIEM Export: Splunk/ELK/Sentinel one-click integration.

Would you like help prototyping a basic version of this in a specific language (e.g., a PoC in Python or Rust)?
