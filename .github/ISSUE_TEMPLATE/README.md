## üè∑Ô∏è Label Guidelines

### Automatic Labels
Templates automatically apply relevant labels, but you can add additional labels:

### Priority Labels
- `critical` - Security vulnerabilities, system breaking issues
- `high-priority` - Core functionality, major features
- `medium-priority` - Important enhancements, optimizations
- `low-priority` - Nice to have features, minor improvements

### Component Labels
- `core` - Core agent and runtime
- `detection` - Detection engine and scanning
- `security` - Security features and hardening
- `platform-specific` - Platform-specific implementations
- `stealth` - Covert operations and anti-detection
- `ui` - User interface and visualization
- `documentation` - Documentation and guides

### Status Labels
- `blocked` - Blocked by dependencies
- `in-progress` - Currently being worked on
- `needs-review` - Ready for code review
- `testing` - In testing phase
- `ready-for-release` - Ready for production release

## üìä Issue Workflow

### 1. Issue Creation
- Select appropriate template
- Fill all required sections
- Apply relevant labels
- Assign to team members if known

### 2. Issue Refinement
- Development team reviews and refines requirements
- Add technical details and specifications
- Update acceptance criteria if needed
- Break down into subtasks if necessary

### 3. Implementation Planning
- Estimate complexity and timeline
- Identify dependencies and blockers
- Plan development phases
- Assign to sprint/milestone

### 4. Development
- Create feature branch
- Implement according to acceptance criteria
- Write tests as specified in template
- Update documentation

### 5. Testing & Review
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Perform security review for security-related issues
- Execute testing strategy from template
- Code review and quality assurance

### 6. Completion
- Merge to main branch
- Update issue with final implementation notes
- Close issue with reference to completed work
- Update related documentation

## üîí Security Considerations

### Sensitive Information
- **Never** include sensitive data, credentials, or secrets in issues
- Use generic examples for configuration and code samples
- Reference external secure documentation for sensitive details
- Consider using private repositories for highly sensitive features

### Responsible Disclosure
- Security vulnerabilities should use GitHub's security advisory system
- Follow responsible disclosure practices for discovered issues
- Coordinate with security team before publishing security-related templates
- Ensure all security features comply with legal and ethical guidelines

## ü§ù Contributing to Templates

### Template Improvements
