## üéØ Component Overview

**Related to**: Cross-Platform Agent (Rust + Golang Core)

<!-- Describe which part of the cross-platform agent this issue addresses -->

## üìã Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture
- [ ] **Primary Language**: Rust for core agent and low-level system interactions
- [ ] **Secondary Language**: Golang for networking, concurrent operations, and module orchestration  
- [ ] **Module System**: Plugin-based architecture supporting hot-swappable modules
- [ ] **Inter-Process Communication**: Secure communication channels between Rust core and Go modules

### Cross-Platform Support
- [ ] **Windows**: Windows 10+ (x64, ARM64)
- [ ] **Linux**: Linux distributions with kernel 4.0+ (x64, ARM64)
- [ ] **macOS**: macOS 10.15+ (x64, ARM64/Apple Silicon)

### System Integration
- [ ] **System API Hooks**: Native OS API integration for process, file, network, and registry monitoring
- [ ] **Privilege Management**: Ability to escalate privileges when necessary while maintaining security
- [ ] **Service Installation**: Register as system service/daemon with auto-start capabilities
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Minimal CPU/memory footprint with configurable resource limits

## üîí Security Features
- [ ] **Code Signing**: Digital signatures for all agent binaries
- [ ] **Sandboxing**: Isolated execution environment for untrusted modules
- [ ] **Encrypted Communication**: TLS 1.3 for all inter-component communications
- [ ] **Anti-Tampering**: Self-integrity checks and protection against modification

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Agent successfully installs and runs as a service on all target platforms
- [ ] Module loading/unloading system works without agent restart
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 50MB during idle operation
- [ ] CPU usage under 2% during normal operation
- [ ] Secure API for module registration and communication
- [ ] Agent startup time under 5 seconds
- [ ] Graceful shutdown and cleanup procedures

### Should Have
- [ ] Configuration management via encrypted config files
- [ ] Automatic update mechanism with rollback capability
- [ ] Health monitoring and self-recovery features
- [ ] Comprehensive logging with configurable verbosity
- [ ] Performance metrics collection and reporting

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Agent clustering for distributed deployments
- [ ] Remote management capabilities
- [ ] Integration with system package managers
- [ ] Docker/container deployment support

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Development Phase
<!-- Select the relevant phase -->
- [ ] Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Phase 2: Go Integration  
- [ ] Phase 3: Security Hardening
- [ ] Phase 4: Production Features

### Technical Stack
- **Rust**: tokio, serde, clap, log, windows-rs, nix
- **Golang**: cobra, logrus, grpc, protobuf
- **Build System**: Cargo for Rust, Go modules for Golang
