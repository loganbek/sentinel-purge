- [ ] **Update Verification**: Cryptographic signature verification for all updates
- [ ] **Communication Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- [ ] **Data Protection**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- [ ] **Key Management**: Secure key derivation and rotation mechanisms

### Air-Gapped Operation
- [ ] **No Cloud Dependency**: Full functionality without internet connectivity
- [ ] **Local Threat Intelligence**: Embedded signature databases
- [ ] **Offline Updates**: Manual update packages with signature verification
- [ ] **Local Certificate Authority**: Self-signed certificates for air-gapped environments

### Anti-Tampering Measures

- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted with AES-256
- [ ] Secure update mechanism with signature verification
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets in binaries

### Should Have
- [ ] HSM integration for code signing
- [ ] Certificate pinning for update servers
- [ ] Runtime application self-protection (RASP)
- [ ] Secure memory allocation and cleanup
- [ ] Audit logging for all security-relevant events
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Hardware attestation support
- [ ] Secure boot integration
- [ ] Zero-knowledge proof mechanisms
- [ ] Homomorphic encryption for sensitive operations
