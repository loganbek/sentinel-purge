# SentinelPurge Stealth Component

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the stealth component implementation for SentinelPurge.

## Overview

The stealth component provides advanced covert operations and anti-detection features for SentinelPurge, allowing the tool to operate undetected by APTs and sophisticated threat actors. This component is designed with security, modularity, and cross-platform compatibility in mind.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **StealthController** - Central management of all covert operations
2. **IdentityManager** - Process identity and disguise operations  
3. **SleepScheduler** - Dormancy periods and awakening conditions
4. **EvasionEngine** - Anti-analysis and detection evasion capabilities
5. **CommunicationSteganography** - Covert communications and steganography

### Platform-Specific Implementations

- **Windows**: Process hollowing, DLL hijacking, WMI persistence, ETW evasion, AMSI bypass
- **Linux**: LD_PRELOAD stealth, process name manipulation, systemd unit masquerading
- **macOS**: Launch agent disguise, code injection, keychain manipulation, Spotlight evasion

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Stealth Operation Modes
- [x] **Silent Mode**: Minimal system footprint and observable activity
- [x] **Hibernation Mode**: Extended dormancy with periodic wake cycles
- [x] **Mimicry Mode**: Disguise as legitimate system processes
- [x] **Ghost Mode**: Advanced evasion of security monitoring
- [x] **Adaptive Mode**: Dynamic behavior modification based on environment

### ✅ Anti-Detection Measures
- [x] **Process Masking**: Dynamic process name and signature changing
- [x] **Memory Obfuscation**: Memory pattern randomization and encryption framework
- [x] **Network Stealth**: Traffic mimicry and communication obfuscation
- [x] **File System Hiding**: Covert file storage and access patterns
- [x] **Registry Camouflage** (Windows): Disguised registry operations

### ✅ Evasion Techniques
- [x] **Signature Morphing**: Runtime signature and hash modification
- [x] **Behavioral Camouflage**: Legitimate activity pattern simulation
- [x] **Timing Randomization**: Unpredictable operation scheduling
- [x] **Resource Throttling**: Adaptive resource usage to avoid detection
- [x] **Communication Encryption**: Secure, anonymous communication channels

### ✅ Environmental Awareness
- [x] **Security Tool Detection**: Identify active security software
- [x] **Monitoring Evasion**: Detect and evade system monitoring
- [x] **Sandbox Detection**: Recognize analysis environments
- [x] **VM Detection**: Identify virtualized environments
- [x] **Debugging Detection**: Detect debugging and analysis attempts

## Configuration

The stealth component is highly configurable through the `SentinelConfig` structure:

```rust
let mut config = SentinelConfig::default();

// Configure stealth mode
config.stealth.mode = StealthMode::Ghost;
config.stealth.max_cpu_usage = 1.0; // 1% CPU max
config.stealth.max_memory_mb = 10;   // 10MB max

// Configure sleep patterns
config.sleep.min_sleep_secs = 300;   // 5 minutes
config.sleep.max_sleep_secs = 3600;  // 1 hour
config.sleep.randomize_cycles = true;

// Configure evasion techniques
config.evasion.vm_detection = true;
config.evasion.sandbox_detection = true;
config.evasion.debugger_detection = true;
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Initialization

```rust
use sentinel_purge::{init_with_config, SentinelConfig};
use sentinel_purge::stealth::init_stealth;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config = SentinelConfig::default();
    
    // Initialize SentinelPurge
    init_with_config(config.clone()).await?;
    
    // Initialize stealth subsystem
    let stealth_controller = init_stealth(&config).await?;
    
    // Start stealth operations
    stealth_controller.start().await?;
    
    // Your APT hunting logic here...
    
    // Stop stealth operations
    stealth_controller.stop().await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Advanced Stealth Operations

```rust
// Trigger immediate evasion response
stealth_controller.trigger_evasion().await?;

// Enter sleep mode for 1 hour
let duration = Some(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(3600));
stealth_controller.enter_sleep_mode(duration).await?;

// Adapt behavior based on environment
stealth_controller.adapt_behavior().await?;

// Get current metrics
let metrics = stealth_controller.get_metrics().await;
println!("Evasion success rate: {:.1}%", metrics.evasion_success_rate() * 100.0);
```

## Security Considerations

### Memory Safety
- All components are implemented in Rust for memory safety
- No unsafe blocks used except where absolutely necessary
- Secure memory management and cleanup

### Cryptographic Security  
- Uses `ring` library for cryptographic operations
- Secure random number generation
- Proper key management and rotation

### Anti-Analysis Protection
- Code obfuscation ready framework
- Anti-debugging techniques
- VM and sandbox detection
- API hooking detection

### Operational Security
- Minimal logging of sensitive information
- Secure cleanup of temporary artifacts
- Anonymous operation without attribution
- Encrypted communication channels

## Performance Metrics

The stealth component is designed for minimal resource usage:

- **CPU Usage**: <1% during stealth mode
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB during covert operations  
- **Network Stealth**: Communications indistinguishable from legitimate traffic
- **Startup Time**: Enter covert mode within 30 seconds

## Testing

Comprehensive tests validate stealth functionality:

```bash
# Run all stealth tests
cargo test --test stealth_integration

# Run specific test
cargo test test_stealth_initialization

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```
